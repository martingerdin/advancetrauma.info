# Rationale 

Trauma is a massive global health issue. Many training programmes have been developed to help physicians in the initial management of trauma patients. Among these programmes, Advanced Trauma Life Support® (ATLS®) is the most popular, having trained over one million physicians worldwide. Despite its widespread use, there are no controlled trials showing that ATLS® improves patient outcomes. Multiple systematic reviews emphasise the need for such trials.

# Aim 

To compare the effects of ATLS® training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients.

# Primary Outcome 

In-hospital mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department.

# Trial Design 

Batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial in India.

# Trial Population 

Adult trauma patients presenting to the emergency department of a participating hospital.

# Sample Size 

30 clusters and 4320 patients.

# Eligibility Criteria

Hospitals are secondary or tertiary hospitals in India that admit or refer/transfer for admission at least 400 patients with trauma per year.

Clusters are one or more units of physicians providing initial trauma care in the emergency department of tertiary hospitals in India.

Patients participants are adult trauma patients who presents to the emergency department of participating hospitals and are admitted or transferred for admission.

# Intervention 

The intervention will be ATLS® training, a proprietary 2.5 day course teaching a standardised approach to trauma patient care using the concepts of a primary and secondary survey. Physicians will be trained in an accredited ATLS® training facility in India.

# Ethical Considerations 

We will use an opt-out consent approach for collection of routinely recorded data. We will obtain informed consent for collection of non-routinely recorded data, such as quality of life and disability outcomes. Patients who are unconscious or lack a legally authorized representative will be included under a waiver of informed consent. Note that consent here refers to consent to data collection.
